# PROJECT 2 - Interactive Full-Stack Application - Michael Mallon, Charles Hernandez, Joshua Diehl, Shane Hubernak

## Our Application

DaySpaw is a web app that is designed to be used by the employees at a Doggie Daycare/ Day Spa location. Our app allows employees to add customers, set (and view) appointments as well as send emails to customers when their dog is ready to be picked up.

<br>

### Motivation:
As the owner of a Day Spaw :feet:
I need to track customer and doggie transactions
With a web app that is accessible from all of the terminals at the facility

<br>

### Problems we solved:
    * Used Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API
    * Used Handlebars.js as the template engine
    * Used MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
    * Used JawsDB to host data on Heroku
    * Wrote both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
    * Implemented NodeMailer to send emails to customers
    * Included authentication (express-session and cookies)
    * Deployed using Heroku (with data)

<br />

## Technologies we used:
